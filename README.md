# The-Stochastic-Crystal-Plasticity-SCP-Simulator-with-Qianran-Yu-
The SCP simulation package contains a computer code written in C++. It is a newly developed stochastic solver for crystal plasticity problem. We have confirmed its validity with the case of uniaxial loading of tungsten single crystals.
